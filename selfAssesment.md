# Self-Assesment and History

As of the time of this writing, I have been in the software engineering field for nearly 15 years. I’ve done work in many different contexts from single person development projects for local businesses, to working in part of a small team building a small portion of functionality for multimillion-dollar development projects for Fortune 100 companies or government entities. Over the years I’ve played nearly every role needed in the Software Development Lifecycle. My roles have ranged from developer, tester, team lead, project manager, requirements gathering, user acceptance testing and more. 

While I have a great deal of experience, in today’s job market there seems to be one requirement that comes above all others. In fact, experience seems to be irrelevant without this key ingredient. Despite the fact I have years of real-world experience, with rare exception getting a foot in the door without a degree is nearly impossible. 

In the field of Computer Science there seems to be a rather precarious dichotomy between experience and education. At times, education and experience work hand-in-glove to bring about the best in each individual. However, just as often, experience and education are at odds with each other leaving a recent graduate unprepared for what awaits them in the real world.
