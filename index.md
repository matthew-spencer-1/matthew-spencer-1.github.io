## Technology Generalist: If it needs to be done, I can do it!

### One can have the best pedigree in the world, and still have the work ethic of a sloth. In this world results matter. I produce results. On time delivery, unexpected, accurate and complete solutions to complex problems due to full and complete understanding of requirements. You want results: pedigree is irrelevant.
