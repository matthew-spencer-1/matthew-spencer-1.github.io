# Technology Generalist:  If it needs to be done, I can do it!

**_One can have the best pedigree in the world, and still have the work ethic of a sloth. In this world results matter. I produce results. On time delivery, unexpected, accurate and complete solutions to complex problems due to full and complete understanding of requirements. You want results: pedigree is irrelevant._**

# Professional Overview
I am [adaptable and a learner](/ProjectNaratives/CliftonStrengths.pdf); first, second, and foremost. For me, there is nothing more satisfying than being thrown at a project that is a little outside my wheelhouse. The truth is, this is where I do my best work. All too often people want to stay in their lane, practicing what they know until they have it perfected. For me that won't work. It's so much better, in my mind, to be ready to lend a hand where and when it is needed. I'm being very direct and stating I'm not an expert at any one thing. That may seem bad, but let me give you a [frank and honest assesment](/selfAssesment.md) of how my education and experience combine to create the capability to handle any tasks thrown my way.

# Portfolio Projects

## OpenGL
An implementation of graphics using OpenGL. Creation of a simple object using a minimal number of triangles. Take a look at the [overview page](/openGL.md)
